## 10-09-2021 Class five
Homework: 
1. Please modify/write the prime number checking python program so it would run many times as you would want to until you tell it to stop.
2. (Optional) It seems the house the Bunny is adventuring in does not have a bathroom and also does not have a bedroom. Can you add to the house one or two bathroom(s) and if you like, add a bedroom so Johnny can hide his basket there?

## 10-02-2021 Class four
Homework: 
1. Execute the attached simple_dice_array.py program using different inputs as the program is asking. Read through the program and review what we learned in the class. You are welcome to bring any question you may have to your teachers in class or in email off class.
2. Please use array to write a python program to calculate 
1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + .... + 98 * 98 + 99 * 99 + 100 * 100. Basically you need to creat an array and put the numbers in the array then do the calculation.

## 09-25-2021 Class three

Homework:
1. Assume N is a positive integer bigger than 4. Please use what you learned in the class to write a python program to calculate 
1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + .... + N * N. Please execute the program and make sure it works as desire: i.e. the program should take a positive integer from the commandline user input, and perform the calculation. Please also consider following problems:
* What happens if you enter in the command line a negative number accidentally? Can you prevent that from happening? 
* What happens if you enter a nonnumeric letter? Can you prevent that from happening?
 

2. Attached please find several simple_dice.py python programs we used in the class for rolling dice. Try to run it. One of the problems with these programs if it works only for Die 6, and would not work with a die with faces like 4 or 20. How can we make the programs to work with dice having 4 faces or 20 faces? Please try to find your answers, and we will answer it in next class.

## 09-18-2021 Class two
* Code from last week

Homework:
1. Please use what you learned in the class to write a python program to calculate 
1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + .... + 98 * 98 + 99 * 99 + 100 * 100.
2. Attached please find 2_simple_dice.py python program we used in the class for rolling dice. Try to run it. Question: how many times should you roll the dice so you can get better probability of a certain number closer to the 1/6 i.e. 0.167 probability?


## 09-11-2021 Class one
Homework:

1. Type the attached program exactly as it is written (including not omitting any space) in https://replit.com python program space as we did the class;
2. Run the program and answer following questions:
a. One student (Clara?) in the class said when rolling dice, the probability of each number on the die to show is equal. For a die with 6 sides, the probability should be 1/6. However, in the class, we rolled 6 times, 5 and 4 showed up twice, 3 didn't show up and another two numbers showed only once. It seems the probability is not 1/6 i.e. 0.166667. What is wrong?
b. Please roll the dice as many times as you can using the simple_dice.py program so that the probability of each number to show would be closer to 1/6. How many times do you have to roll so that the probability of each number to show would be in between 0.14 and 0.18? Can you get the probability number even closer to 0.1666667? Why?
c. Can you change line 11 in the program to sides = 4 then run the program? How if you change it to sides = 20?

Note: for 2a, you would need to count how many times the program rolls, and the times of each number show. The probability of each number shows equals to (the times of each number show divided by total times the program rolls).
