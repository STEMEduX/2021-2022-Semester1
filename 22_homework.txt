1. Please run the 22_Pong.py python program in replit.com, play the game with parents, sisters/brothers, or class mates, friends. Note: LEFT paddle is controlled by WSAD keys and RIGHT paddle is controlled by arrow keys;
2. Try to modify the proram 22_Pong.py as you want to such as change the speeds of ball, paddle, color etc and see how the game would change.

In next class we will continue to look into the coding in the program with the goals you can start programming a board game yourself.
