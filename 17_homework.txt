1. Review 17_8queens.py program and 17_Eight_Queens_and_Backtracking.pptx, so that you would be able to explain to the class in your own language how the backtracking algorithm would be able to address the Eight Queeens problem.
2. One observation we had in the class for any solution to eight queen problem is any row and any column can only show up once. Another observation is any solution to the problem is a combination of the permutation of rows and the permutations of columns even though a combination of these permutations may not be a valid solution. How can we use the observations to improve our python solution for the Eight Queen problem?
